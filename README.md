## Predicting BABIP From Statcast Gamelogs

Co-authored this project for Foundations of Data Science (DS3000). This project analyzes BABIP and Statcast metrics and attempts to build a model to predict BABIP with batted-ball metrics. We also try and find whether or not and which basic statistics contribute to a player's BABIP.
